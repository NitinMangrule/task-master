# Hierarchical Location Tree with Interactive SVG Rendering

## Project Overview

This project showcases a hierarchical tree structure for displaying locations. Users can interact with the application to render an SVG floor plan by selecting the last item in the hierarchy (e.g., "Building A", "Building B"). The application includes interactive features such as SVG rotation, color selection, and shape filtering.

## Features

### Hierarchical Tree Structure
- Displays a nested tree of locations.
- Clicking on the last node in the hierarchy renders an SVG floor plan.

### SVG Rendering
- Dynamically loads an SVG floor plan when a building is selected.

### Interactive Features
- **Rotate SVG**: A toggle button rotates the SVG by 180 degrees.
- **Color Selector**: Choose from random colors to apply to all locations within the SVG.
- **Shape Filtering**: Filter locations by shape (circle, rectangle, or star) based on their IDs.
